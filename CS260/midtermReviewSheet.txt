Midterm Review Sheet

Types of networks- LAN, MAN, WAN
Encapsulation, packets, services, interfaces, protocols
The OSI model- all layers
The TCP/IP stack- all layers
Be able to compare and contrast TCP/IP and OSI

ARPANET- what was it, how did it grow, how is it related to TCP/IP
IANA and InterNIC
RFC’s- what they are and who proposes and maintains them  (You won’t need to memorize any RFC’s)

TCP- be familiar with the TCP header (you won’t need to memorize it but know the flags and what they mean)
TCP Session- how a connection is made, data is transferred, and how a connection is ended
TCP timers- what timers does TCP need and how they work
Delayed duplicates- what are they, how are they solved, what problems do they cause?
UDP- what is it and why is it used?
Differences between connection oriented and connectionless protocols
Congestion- how does TCP handle congestions?  
Algorithms- Nagle, Clark, Jacobson, Karn.  Silly window syndrome
What happens when a packet is dropped
Ports- what application layer protocols run on what ports (see slides)

IP- what is it and how did it came to be
IPv6- know what it is and why it was created
Routing- how packets are sent on networks
Interior/Exterior gateway protocols- know generally what these are and some of the concerns that each one must deal with and how they address those concerns
Network devices- hubs, switches, routers, and bridges
IP classes and subnetting- be able to calculate subnets. 
Reserved IP address ranges- know them (on the slides)
NAT- what it is, how it works, and problems that it creates and solves
NAT punch through- be able to describe how this works and what is required to make it possible

Winsock-  how to create a connection in winsock (you don’t need to know the exact code, just the steps and what order they are done in)
How to listen for incoming connections
Good error handling and cleaning up resources
Blocking and non-blocking sockets
Threading- creating threads, locking (critical_section, mutex, semaphore), events
